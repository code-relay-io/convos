https://github.com/convos-chat/convos/issues/577

Remember your job is to make *incremental* progress, break the task into smaller tasks, or finish something in 15 minutes, then pass it along to the next contributor. 
No responsibility, only fun.

If you don't finish, add your next task to the readme.md. Oh and when you're done make a pull request to the code-relay repo.

# Convos - Multiuser chat application

Convos is a multiuser chat application that runs in your web browser.

The supported chat protocol is currently IRC, but Convos can be extended to
support other protocols as well.

See [convos.chat](http://convos.chat) for more details.

The backend is powered by [Mojolicious](http://mojolicious.org), while the
frontend is held together by the progressive JavaScript framework
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## Quick start guide

See "[Getting started](https://convos.chat/doc/start)" for other
options and more information.

### Install locally

```bash
curl https://convos.chat/install.sh | sh -
./convos/script/convos daemon
```

That's it! After the two commands above, you can point your browser to
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start chatting.

### Docker install

You can use the command below to pull and run convos:

```bash
docker pull convos/convos:stable
mkdir -p $HOME/convos/data
docker run -it -p 8080:3000 -v $HOME/convos/data:/data convos/convos:stable
```

Note that [Nordaaker/convos](hub.docker.com/r/Nordaaker/convos/) will be around
for a while, but the new official image is "convos/convos".

## How to make a release

Notes for developers so a new release is made in a proper way.

```bash
# Update with the recent changes and make sure the timestamp is proper
$EDITOR Changes

# Build the production assets and update and check that all the files
# have the correct version information
./script/convos build release
```

## Branch overview

### alpha

THe "[alpha](https://github.com/convos-chat/convos/tree/alpha)" branch branch
will be force pushed to when we need to make a new docker build with working
assets, but with experimental features. Example:

```bash
git checkout -b user/some-feature
$EDITOR assets/store/Conversation.js
./script/convos build
git add .
git commit -a -m "made some experimental changes"
git push origin -f user/some-feature:alpha
```

### master

"[master](https://github.com/convos-chat/convos/tree/master)" is for
developers. It's mostly stable, but might require extra tools and packages to
run. This branch might have outdated assets (JavaScript, CSS files), so it
might not work properly.

### stable

"[stable](https://github.com/convos-chat/convos/tree/stable)" is the branch you
should use, if you want to clone and run Convos. The JavaScript assets and the
Perl code will be in sync here.

### www.convos.chat

"[www.convos.chat](https://github.com/convos-chat/convos/tree/www.convos.chat)" is the source
for [http://convos.chat](http://convos.chat), which is powered by the built-in CMS
In Convos.
